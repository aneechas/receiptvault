## 💡 Notes for Development

### Important Considerations:
1. **Flutter SDK**: Install Flutter via Homebrew or download manually
2. **iOS Setup**: Configure Xcode and signing certificates
3. **Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` after Flutter installation
4. **GitHub**: Create repository at github.com/aneechas/receiptvault before pushing
5. **Testing**: Use iOS Simulator for development, physical device for final testing

### Ready to Use:
- ✅ All data models with proper serialization
- ✅ Complete database with CRUD operations
- ✅ OCR service with advanced preprocessing
- ✅ Receipt parser with UK-specific patterns
- ✅ Theme system with dark mode
- ✅ Navigation routing for all screens

### Camera Implementation Tips:
1. Request camera permissions in Info.plist
2. Use CameraController from camera package
3. Implement preview with AspectRatio widget
4. Save captured image to temp directory
5. Pass image path to OCR service
6. Display results in Review screen
